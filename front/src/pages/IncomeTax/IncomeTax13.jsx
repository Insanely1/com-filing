          Even after filing your Income Tax Return (ITR) on time, you may still receive
          notices from the Income Tax Department (ITD). While this can be concerning, it is
          often a routine part of the tax process. Some notices request additional
          information or clarifications that require timely responses, while others are
          simply for your information. It is important to carefully verify the authenticity
          of any notice before taking further action to ensure proper compliance and avoid
          unnecessary penalties.

          What is an Income Tax Notice?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-800">
          An income tax notice is an official letter sent by the Income Tax Department to a
          taxpayer. It informs the taxpayer about an issue or query related to their tax
          return or tax payments. The notice could be about missing information,
          discrepancies in the filed return, tax assessments, or a request for additional
          documents. When a taxpayer receives such a notice, they are required to respond
          within the given time to resolve the matter with the tax authorities.

          IT Notice Under Section 133(6)
        </h3> 

        <p className="text-black mb-4">
          Under the E-Verification Scheme 2021, the Income Tax Department may issue a
          notice under Section 133(6) if discrepancies are found between the data
          reported in your Income Tax Return (ITR) and the information available in the
          Annual Information Statement (AIS).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">
          Common Reasons for Receiving Notice u/s 133(6):

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-black space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            ITR not filed even though income exceeds the basic exemption limit as per AIS data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Income such as salary, interest, or capital gains is reflected in the AIS, but not correctly reported in the ITR.
          </li>
          <li>
            Significant expenses (e.g., purchase of property, foreign travel, mutual fund/stocks investments) are reported in AIS but are inconsistent with the income declared in the ITR.

          <li>
