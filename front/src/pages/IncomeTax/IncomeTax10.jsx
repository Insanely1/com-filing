      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As per Section 195, any individual or entity responsible for making
        payment to a non-resident must deduct income tax at the applicable rate
        before making the payment. The remitter must submit Form 15CA and, if
        applicable, Form 15CB, certified by a Chartered Accountant.

        Form 15CA is an online declaration submitted on the income tax website
        before remitting payment to a non-resident. It helps the IT department
        monitor foreign transactions and tax compliance.
