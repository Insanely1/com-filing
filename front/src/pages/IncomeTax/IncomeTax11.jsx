      <p>
        In India, it is mandatory for businesses to have a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN). This number is issued by the Income Tax Department and serves as a unique identifier for individuals or entities responsible for deducting or collecting Tax at source. It is compulsory to mention the TAN in all TDS returns and other income tax-related documents. Non-compliance may result in penalties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding what the TAN registration number is, its purpose, and usage is crucial for maintaining compliance with the Income Tax Department.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">TAN Registration Process in India: A Comprehensive Guide</h2>
      <p>
        In India, the Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN) can be registered through two primary methods: 
        <strong> online</strong> and <strong>offline</strong>. Applying online is quicker and more efficient, while the offline method may suit those who prefer a paper-based process.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Offline TAN Registration Process</h3>
      <p>
        For manual application, fill out <strong>Form 49B</strong> (TAN allotment form) and submit it with the application fee to any <strong>TIN-Facilitation Center (TIN-FC)</strong> of Protean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, applicants can download the form from the NSDL website, fill it out offline, and physically submit it with the required documents and fee at the TIN-FC.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Online TAN Registration Process</h3>
      <p>
        Applicants can apply for TAN online through the official <strong>NSDL website</strong>. It is important to carefully read the instructions, complete the form accurately, and submit it electronically for processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mandatory PAN:</strong> Providing a valid PAN is required. Even if using an older format for the tax deduction account number, a PAN must be submitted. It's recommended to complete PAN registration in tandem with TAN registration, if not already done.
      </p>
