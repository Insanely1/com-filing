      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black-600">ITR 6 Applicability</h2>
      <p>
        ITR 6 applies to all companies except those claiming an exemption under Section 11 of the Income Tax Act. Section 11 applies to income derived from property held under a trust or legal obligation for charitable or religious purposes. Therefore, companies with income used for charitable or religious purposes are not eligible to file ITR 6.
