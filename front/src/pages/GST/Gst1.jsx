        GST Registration is a process by which businesses in India register themselves under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. This registration is mandatory for businesses whose turnover exceeds the prescribed threshold limit.

        The GST registration process involves submitting an application online, providing necessary documents, and obtaining a unique Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN). This number is essential for compliance with GST laws, filing returns, and availing input tax credits.
