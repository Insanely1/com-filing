      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Overview: GST Registration in India</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Since its introduction on 1 July 2017, the Goods & Services Tax (GST) has been mandatory for all service providers, traders, manufacturers, and even freelancers in India. The GST system was implemented to replace Central and state-level taxes such as Service Tax, Excise Duty, CST, Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, and VAT, making the tax process more streamlined. The GST registration process charges vary depending on the type of business and turnover.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For taxpayers whose annual turnover is less than ₹1.5 crore, the GST framework provides an option for a composition scheme. This scheme allows them to undergo simplified GST procedures and pay taxes at a predetermined rate according to their turnover.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The GST mechanism operates throughout various stages of the supply chain. This includes acquiring raw materials, production, wholesale, retail, and the eventual sale to the end consumer. Notably, GST is imposed at every one of these steps. For example, when a product is produced in West Bengal and then used in Uttar Pradesh, the GST revenue generated is allocated entirely to Uttar Pradesh, emphasizing the consumption-based nature of GST.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Key Components of GST</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India is structured around three primary components:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST):</strong> This tax is levied by the Central Government on the supply of goods and services within a particular state. CGST applies to transactions carried out entirely within the boundaries of one state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>State Goods and Services Tax (SGST):</strong> SGST is charged by the State Government on the supply of goods and services within its jurisdiction. Similar to CGST, SGST is also limited to transactions happening within a specific state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST):</strong> This tax is imposed by the Central Government on the supply of goods and services that occur between different states or between a state and a Union Territory. IGST is relevant for transactions where goods or services cross state or Union Territory boundaries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Who is required to register for GST?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        GST registration process is essential for the following persons:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">

        <li>Service Providers: Those with an aggregate annual turnover surpassing Rs. 20 lakhs. For special category states, this limit is Rs. 10 lakhs.</li>
        <li>Exemptions: Entities dealing exclusively in GST-exempted goods or services are not bound by these thresholds.</li>
        <li>Previously Registered Entities: Entities registered under older tax frameworks (like Excise, VAT, Service Tax, etc.) need to migrate to GST.</li>
        <li>Inter-State Suppliers: Any entity or individual involved in inter-state supply of goods.</li>
        <li>Casual Taxable Entities: Those who undertake taxable supply occasionally.</li>

        GST registration can be obtained voluntarily by any person or entity, irrespective of turnover. GST registration becomes mandatory if a person or entity sells goods or services beyond a certain turnover. GST apply online allows for a quick and convenient process.

        <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Any person or entity providing services of more than Rs. 20 lakhs (Rs. 10 lakhs in special category states) must obtain GST registration.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Goods Suppliers:</strong> As per notification No.10/2019, any person exclusively supplying goods and whose aggregate turnover exceeds Rs. 40 lakhs must register. To qualify for the Rs. 40 lakhs limit:

        <li>Should not be providing any services.</li>
        <li>Should not be engaged in intra-state supplies in certain states (e.g., Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, etc.).</li>
        <li>Should not supply ice cream, pan masala, or tobacco.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
